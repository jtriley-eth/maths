# Maths

this is a collection of useful math stuff i find along the way. the notes are
meant to give reasonable context and build on one another. recommended order of
reading is as follows:

- [Set Theory](./src/set-theory.ipynb)
- [Group Theory](./src/group-theory.ipynb)
- Category Theory (todo)
- Linear Algebra (todo)
